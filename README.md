# Demo 2

Created a file on my local mahcine. The intent is to turn it into a Git repo.
git init command is used.
NEXT, CREATE EMPTY REPO ON GIT HUB
Then stage changes with "git add ."
Next, "git commit -m "insert whatever" -m "insert description"
Next, " git remote add origin INSERT SSH OF REPO"
Next, "git push -u origin master"
After this step "git push" can be used, as the "-u origin master" sets the upstream.
"git remote -v" can be used to check any remote repos connected to local repo.
